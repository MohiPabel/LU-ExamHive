		<p>In the Nineties, my background as a volunteer in pediatric hospitals with ABIO Association (a charity
			association supporting Italian pediatric hospitals), made me understand the importance of inspiring hope to

			personality. It was thicker. The trees had grown taller. The ti plants shaded the green forest a sinister

			had to devise intricate plans just to sneak out for morning adventures.</p>
